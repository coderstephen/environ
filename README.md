A simple package for discovering information about an execution environment and platform. Generic name, generic purpose.

Note that this package is a work-in-progress. See [Contributing](#contributing) below if you want to help out.

## Overview
The purpose of this package is to provide a simple interface for discovering information about a execution environment, like what operating system is installed, number of processors, or what PHP interpreter is being used. I created this because there wasn't something that already existed for PHP.

## Installation
Install with [Composer](http://getcomposer.org), obviously:

```sh
$ composer require coderstephen/environ
```

## Usage
Extremely simple usage; there are a few stateless classes that provide static methods for querying the system. Below is a very simple example:

```php
use Environ\Platform;

printf("CPU architecture: %s\n", Platform::getArch());
printf("Number of CPU cores: %d\n", Platform::getCpuCount());
printf("Operating system: %s\n", Platform::getOSName());
printf("Linux distro: %s\n", Platform::linuxDistribution());
```

You can also test some of the results environ gives for your current environment with a provided script:

```php
$ vendor/bin/environ-info
```

## Reference
You can view a very detailed reference online [here](http://coderstephen.github.io/environ/api).

## Contributing
Want to contribute? The best way to contribute is to test the code on a wide array of systems with varying setups and to verify the results are as expected. If they aren't, just [create a new issue](https://github.com/coderstephen/environ/issues/new) here on GitHub and we will fix it. If you are adventurous, feel free to fork, patch & submit a pull request that fixes the issue as well.
